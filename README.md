It is a pure API which is made with the django framework.

With this API you can perform create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations on the endpoints.

Here the python script named "pureapi.py" is a file which tests our pure API so you can refer it also.

Here, the project name is "pureapi" and the application name is "updates".

Thank you,
